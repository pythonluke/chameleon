# chameleon
chameleon is a new programming language that is python based. 
For sytax higlighting of chameleon dowload the texteditor notepad++.
Save the file called chameleon as a .xtml file.
Then click on lanuages , define your language, then import file.
Import the file called chameleon.

Now to create a new project you have to have python 3.4 installed.

So in notepad++ create a file with the file extension .cham, the file has to be saved in the chameleon folder.
We will make a simple HelloWorld program.

type:

print "Hello World!";

to execute the file open run chameleon.
It will ask you what file you want to run type your programs filename without the file extension and press enter.
Then it will ask you if you want to run the program type 1 to run.
Next it will ask you if you want to execute another file type n for no, if you had several chameleon files you would say yes, if you had several files
that are dependent on each other type you have to all compile then in the same process otherwise you woud not recieve proper error messages.
Finally it will ask you do you want to have to press space all the time between runs, say y otherwise the program will end and immediatly re run.
If you did this correctly you should get the result Hello World!.

When I say compile I mean it translates the chameleon to python code which the python interpreter can run so if you distribute 
the translated file which is always the filename + .py the user does not have to download any extra files.
